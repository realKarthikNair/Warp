@desc Using QR Codes

Instead of typing the code manually it is possible to scan a QR code.

For a list of supported apps, see the 
$link[href=https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/warp/-/blob/main/README.md#qr-codes](readme file).

Using any other apps might lead to problems scanning the code. The QR code standard is fairly new and not 
all apps have updated their custom QR code format to the standardized version.
